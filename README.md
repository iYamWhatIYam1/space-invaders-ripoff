# space-invaders-ripoff
hello there! this private git is dedicated to hosting my small school project, a Space Invaders ripoff. I set up this git after getting stuck on minor problems and not having a way to revert to older versions, so here we are!!
I will open this up for public viewing as soon as the project is feature-complete, and will continue adding to the project in the future.
The bare minimum feature set will include:
- fully functional horizontal movement
- a ship that fires three bullets on-screen at a time
- an alien wave that progresses towards the player faster and faster as time goes on
- ability to exit with the Escape key
- a title screen that is used with the mouse

Hopefully you enjoy what I have here!
